Reproducible Research
=====================

Independent replication of a scientific study is the best way to evaluate its truth.

Short of replication, a study should be reproducible.

Research is reproducible if data and analysis methods are shared so that others can reproduce the results.
With code, this means sharing your raw data and analytic code for others to use and evaluate.

Sharing code ensures transparency, but not validity.
However, it allows others to more easily judge validity.

Raw data -> processed data -> data analysis -> presentable results

Code allows you to make your workflow/pipelines reproducible.

How can we ensure our research is reproducible?
-----------------------------------------------

- Don't do things by hand.
  - No Excel!
  - Don't download data by clicking a link. 
    - download.file()
  - No copy and pasting to new files.
  - Don't edit data manually.
  - Analysis programs with GUIs can sometimes be problematic.
  - If it has to be done by hand, document it thoroughly.

- Code allows a computer to do all the boring work while keeping an accurate record.
  - Almost guarantees reproducibility.
  - Record your software environment (Computer details, OS, software versions)
    - sessionInfo()
    - date()

- Treat your code as part of your lab notebook.
  - A lab notebook should be written so that a colleague can read it and do exactly what you did.
  - Code should be written the same way, with lots of comments.
  
- Everything of importance should be done in scripts, not interactively.

- Work to ensure reproducibility from the start of a project.

- Use version control.

- Use a non-proprietary file format (e.g. .csv instead of .xls).

- If you generate random numbers or sample from a larger data set, set your seed to ensure the same results each time.
  - set.seed()


Literate programming in R using `knitr`
=======================================

**Basic idea:** Write **data** + **software** + **documentation** (or in this case manuscripts, reports) together.

Analysis code can be divided into text and code "chunks".
Doing so allows us to extract the code for machine readable documents (`tangle`) or produce a human-readable document (`weave`).

Literate programming involves three main steps:

- Separate the narrative from the code.
- Execute source code and return the results.
- Combine the results from the source code with the original narratives to produce a final document.

Installing `knitr`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("knitr", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Knitr supports a variety of documentation formats including `markdown`, `html` and `LaTeX`. 
It also allows for easy export to `PDF` and `HTML`.

What is markdown?
-----------------

Markdown is an incredibly simple semantic file format, not too dissimilar from .doc, .rtf, or .txt.
Markdown makes it easy to write any sort of text (including with links, lists, bullets, etc.) and have it parsed into a variety of formats.

**Good and Bad Practices**

Related: See [best practices](../R-basics/best-practices.Rmd) in the [R-basics folder](../R-basics/).


## Creating a basic knitr document

In RStudio, choose new R Markdown file (easiest way)
or you can create a new text file and save it with extension `.Rmd`.

A basic code chunk looks like this:

<pre><code>```{r}
# some R code
```
</code></pre>
---

You can knit this document using the knit button or do it programmatically using the `knit()` function.

```
library(knitr)
knit("file.Rmd")
```

**What just happened?**

knitr read the Rmd file, then located and ran all the code chunks identified by the backticks, and replaced it with the output of R function calls. If figures are generated from any such calls, they will be included in markdown syntax.  


## Chunk labels

You can also name your code chunks. This allows you to keep all the code in a separate script and just refer to code chunks using meaningful names (e.g. data-processing, analysis, model-fitting, visualization, figures, tables)


```
{r, chunk_name}
```


__Some rules on naming chunks__
* Chunk labels are supposed to be unique idâ€™s in a document.  
* knitr will throw an error if two chunks have the same name.  
* If no chunk names are given, knitr will simply increment from chunk 1, 2,3 etc.

In addition to naming chunks within the curly braces, you can also add a bunch of other options on how that particular code chunk should behave. 

**Other options you can add to the tag**

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ------------ |
| **echo** =   TRUE or FALSE |  to show or hide code.  |
| **eval** =   TRUE or FALSE | to run or skip the code.  |
| **warning** =   TRUE or FALSE | to show or hide function warnings.  |
| **message** =  TRUE or FALSE | to show or hide function R messages.  |
| **results** = "hide"  | will hide results. They will still be executed |
| **fig.height** = | Height of figure  |
| **fig.width** =  | width of figure  |

Once your output markdown files (`.md`) files are generated, you should never edit them because they are automatically generated. Next time you knit the original `.Rmd` files, all the changes in the `.md` file will get wiped out. 

**Write sentences in text with inline output**

```
Include some text `r mean(1:5)`. 
```

**Summarizing output from models.**

<pre><code>```{r fit_model}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
fit = lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp + Solar.R, data = airquality)
```

## Including formatted tables in markdown

```{r showtable, results="asis", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(pandoc)
pander(fit)
```</code></pre>

## Global options

Global options are shared across all the following chunks after the location in which the options are set, and local options in the chunk header can override global options.

<pre><code>```{r setoptions, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
options(width = 60, show.signif.stars = FALSE)
opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, 
            results = "asis", 
            warning = FALSE, 
            message = FALSE, 
            fig.width = 5, 
            fig.height = 4, 
            tidy = TRUE, 
            fig.align = 'center')
```</code></pre>


## Other Options
**Dealing with long running process**

By adding `cache = TRUE` to a code block definition. After the first run, results will be cached. We'll discuss better ways to acheive the same thing using `Make` in the next section.


## Quick reporting

Generating reports in knitr doesn't always have to involve a laborious `.Rmd ` file where scripts need to be broken down into smaller chunks. Sometimes a user might need a simple report generated very quickly from an existing script. The function `stitch()` in knitr makes it possible to generate nicely formatted reports from R scripts. 

knitr provides a template of the source document with default settings which  allows the user to simply pass any R script into this template (consider this one giant code chunk). knitr will  then compile the template to a report. The package currently has build in support for a range of templates from LateX, html, and markdown. To stitch a report:

```
library(knitr) 
stitch("your-script.R")
```
## Additional chunk options

Chunks are extremely flexible and more options (beyond the ones listed in the table above) can be included in the header. These look exactly like the kinds of arguments that one might pass to standard R functions. In the example below, the chunk will only be executed if the condition (in this case x less than 5) is satisfied. 

```
{r chunk_name, eval = if (x < 5) TRUE else FALSE}
```
This allows your document to be dynamic allowing certain chunks to be executed only when specific conditions are met.



## Error handling

By default `knitr` will not stop execution if it encounters an error. It will continue through to the end of the document and include any errors that arise within chunks. The reason for this behavior is that knitr treats the code as if it were fed directly into the R console. Any errors get printed to the screen and the remaining commands are executed. 

To stop knitr as soon as it encounters an error, one can set an option explicitly:

```coffee
opts_knit$set(stop_on_error = 2L)
```

__Possible options for error handling__

| Option | What it does | 
| ------ | ------------ | 
| * **0L** | do not stop on errors, continue on as if code was pasted into R console  |
| * **1L** | when an error occurs, return the results up to this point, ignore the rest of the code within that particular chunk without reporting any further errors. |
| * **2L** | Completely stop upon encountering the first error. |


## Working with graphics in `knitr`

If you use `ggplot2` from the data visualization section, you can have that easily parsed into your document.

```
library(ggplot2)
p <- qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds) + geom_hex()
p 
# no need to explicitly print(p)
```

---

## Code Externalization

Sometimes it can be rather tedious to include dozens of lines of code in the same file as the narrative. In such cases, one can improve readability by externalizing the code into a separate script and simply calling the chunks at the appropriate locations in a document. The code will get read in and executed at those points. There are two steps to making this happen.

First, read the script using `read_chunk()` at the top of any `.Rmd` file
```
read_chunk("source_code.R")
```

This is usually done in an early chunk such as the first chunk of a document, and we can use the chunk `data-processing` later in the source document:


```
{r, data-processing}
```

Then simply call any chunk as needed simply by using its label. You do not have to include any code between the backticks. 

```
## @knitr data-processing
```

Be sure to leave a blank line between chunks.
